I'm interested in the field of unmanned vehicle systems and their various applications, particularly prediction, and perception. I enjoy working with edge devices like Jetson xavier nx and Raspberry Pi to create IoT and robot solutions through hands-on experimentation. My presidency(Spring 2023) in the University of Texas at Arlington's AutonoBots club allowed me to work on robot slam and sensor fusion with lidar and camera data during the National Robotics Challenge in April 2023."
