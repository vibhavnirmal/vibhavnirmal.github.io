        <h4>My name is Vibhav Nirmal</h4>

        <p>I am a graduate student in computer science at the University of Texas at Arlington. I earned my bachelor's degree in computer engineering from LD College of Engineering in Ahmedabad.</p>
        
        <p>I have around one year of experience in the software sector. I've worked with the jewelry augmentation startup Plushvie and the service-based corporation Accenture.</p>

        <p>Robotics and unmanned vehicle systems are two of my passions. Motion planning, control, and perception are the core areas of my research. I have learned some fundamentals of autonomous vehicles using synthetic data, from developing longitudinal and lateral controllers to identifying objects and signs on the road from the Carla simulator. </p>

        <p>In April 2022, our AutonoBots club team from UTA competed in the National Robotics Challenge (thenrc.org). I worked on robot localisation utilizing a realsense camera and sensor fusion with lidar data using ROS and rtabmap. </p>
